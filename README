INTRODUCTION

Mpifold provides fold function using MPI. The folding is split into
two parts. The transformation, which is performed in parallel across
children nodes, and the folding itself, which is performed in sequence
on the parent node, consuming the transformed values as they arrive
from the children nodes.
